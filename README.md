# Capstone Project 1 : Accounting Ledger Application
## Aquatic Accounting Ledger
My Capstone 1 Project is a Java based Console Line Interface (CLI) Application
that will allow users to record, view, and manage financial transactions for an
Aquatic Store. It stores all transactions inside a 'transactions.csv' file so 
users can track their transactions whether it is income or expenses in a simple
and organized way.
